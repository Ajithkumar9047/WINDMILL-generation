# WINDMILL-generation Dataset

## Overview
This repository contains a dataset of windmill generation data for different locations. The data includes information about various windmill sites, their unique model types, peace capacity, daily total generation, and the separate places where these windmills are located.

## Dataset Contents
The dataset is organized into the following columns:

- **WEC-windmill name**: The name of the windmill.
- **WEC Type**: Unique model type of the windmill.
- **Peace Capacity**: The capacity of the windmill in terms of power generation.
- **Generation**: Total generation per day (in an appropriate unit, e.g., kilowatt-hours).
- **Site**: The separate location or place where the windmill is installed.

## Data Samples
Here are a few sample rows from the dataset:

| WEC-windmill name | WEC Type     | Peace Capacity | Generation | Site                  |
|-------------------|--------------|----------------|------------|-----------------------|
| Windmill-001      | Model A      | 100 kW         | 2500 kWh   | Windy Valley, Texas   |
| Windmill-002      | Model B      | 150 kW         | 3800 kWh   | Green Hills, Oregon   |
| Windmill-003      | Model C      | 80 kW          | 2000 kWh   | Coastal Breeze, Florida|
| Windmill-004      | Model A      | 100 kW         | 2400 kWh   | Rocky Highlands, Utah |
